          <div class="text-center , l ">Hello my dear batchmates😊,</div>
          <div class="text-center , l ">Its been so long studying online without sharing any memories with your friends, I bet you are dying to meet them in offline classes. Many of you want to make new friends or want to strengthen existing friendships.  </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">
            I say, there is no better way to strengthen existing friendships and create new ones than by sharing a chess board or by exchanging shuttles🏸, by passing a football⚽ or by giving a kho, by cheering when the team is up or by comforting them when the team is down.
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">My name is PRATHAM SANTOSH GIRI and I am willing to take the responsibility of providing you with the opportunities to make new friends and strengthen the bonds of friendship by organising various sports events in our department.
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">
            I will also be taking the responsibility of bringing the best players forward and leading our department to the top in every sports event. So please VOTE ME for the position of SPORTS SECRETARY in upcoming elections.....

          <div class="text-center , l ">I am playing chess since i was 8 years old and participated in various events and tournaments since then.

        <div class="msg">
          <div class="text-center , l ">Hello dear batchmates,</div>
          <div class="text-center , l "> Myself Aakash Gupta. A very few people know about me(but who cares... we'll get to know each other in offline mode 🥳), since I have rarely interacted with any one in department or my  respective section.  </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">
            The reason is more or less related to the post I am running after. I am a very sportive guy who avoid spending time on social media and rather indulge myself in some or the other sports activity, be it badminton, cricket , kabaddi , volleyball.
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">But my favourite of all is 'athletics and track and field events'. I am the undisputed record holder in my school who have won gold in all the three formats of running (100m, 200m and 400m) twice. I have captained my school in interschool cricket tournament at district level (season ball cricket), and won a good no of matches ( unfortunately never bagged a final trophy).
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">
            I have played all sorts of track and field games and I was connected to them very closely. All these experiences in my high school and junior college have inculcated the values of an ideal sportsman and a decent captain. I have a good grip on volleyball and badminton too.
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l "> I'll definitely prove my worth in our prestigious institute's tournaments. I don't want to be the " all talking and no actin guy", thus I won't say anything more . (Praising yourself feels a little bit embarassing......I felt this while constructing this draft😅😂😂)
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">Being a sportsperson, I believe that I have what it takes to be a good leader/captain. I respect each and everyone's opinion. I promise y'all that I'll take the EEE sports section to new heights, no one could have ever thought of. I'll also formulate a small committee of all the sports secretary candidates since everyone must be good at something in this field , otherwise why would they dare to ask for your precious votes 😅😉
          </div>
          <div class="text-center , l ">❗❗Vote your brother for the new dawn of EEE sports section ❗❗</div>
