          <div class="text-center , l ">Hello my dear batchmates😊,</div>
          <div class="text-center , l ">Its been so long studying online without sharing any memories with your friends, I bet you are dying to meet them in offline classes. Many of you want to make new friends or want to strengthen existing friendships.  </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">
            I say, there is no better way to strengthen existing friendships and create new ones than by sharing a chess board or by exchanging shuttles🏸, by passing a football⚽ or by giving a kho, by cheering when the team is up or by comforting them when the team is down.
          </div>
    
          <div class="text-center , l ">My name is PRATHAM SANTOSH GIRI and I am willing to take the responsibility of providing you with the opportunities to make new friends and strengthen the bonds of friendship by organising various sports events in our department.
